## About Hakkem

Researchers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia face difficulties submitting applications for
promotions and publication in scientific journals. The most critical point that falls within
these difficulties is finding a reviewer with sufficient experience in the field of research
to be evaluated. Also, it takes long periods to issue the results of the review, and bias in
the review results, and sometimes inaccuracy. All of these affect the quality of scientific
research and hinder academic researchers’ progress in general.

In this project, the” Hakkem” platform, we seek to build an integrated peer review platform
that aims to enable researchers, reviewers, universities, and scientific journals to register
on it. Which facilitates and manages the communication process between all parties.

In addition to contributing to managing and facilitating review requests for promotion or
publication. This is done with the help of an AI Agent that will be developed using Natural
Language Processing algorithms to analyze research information (title, abstract). Then, it
will provide admins with a list of the most appropriate and experienced reviewers in this
research field to evaluate it, in addition to helping in conducting a preliminary assessment
before proceeding with a request for promotion or publication. It will evaluate the research
based on the unified standards for scientific research and from a linguistic and grammatical
perspective and suggest tips and improvements for the researcher.

The ”Hakkem” platform helps accelerate the process of reviewing scientific research.
Whether for promotion or publication, in addition to ensuring more accurate review results
by selecting the most appropriate reviewers to review the research. It also strengthens the
link between the scientific research community by enabling researchers to communicate
with each other through the platform, and it also contributes to supporting the vision of
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 2030 by enhancing and supporting scientific research and
innovation.
